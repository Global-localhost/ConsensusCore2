# ConsensusCore2 [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/PacificBiosciences/ConsensusCore2.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/PacificBiosciences/ConsensusCore2)

`ConsensusCore2` embodies core C++ routines underlying the Arrow HMM
algorithm for PacBio multi-sequence consensus.  Arrow is the successor
to the Quiver model---a CRF model that was embodied in the
`ConsensusCore` C++ library.

Compared to Quiver, the Arrow model is more statistically principled
and easier and more robust to train.
